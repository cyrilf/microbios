## DESCRIPTION ðŸ“–

**Microbios** provide a generic code that allows simulations of **cellular automata** experiments.  
The most famous one being the **Game of Life** (that you can find on the [live version](https://cyrilf.github.io/microbios/) or on the [experiments folder](https://github.com/cyrilf/microbios/tree/5bcf07ffca6d75c2462a3c8af5e05b2dbc402961/src/experiments)).

This is an open-source project, licensed under MIT.

Feel free to submit a PR to create more experiments.

## ROADMAP ðŸš€

- [ ] ðŸš’ Extract the simulation code 'engine' out of this vue project (to be an external dependency easily re-usable)
- [ ] ðŸ–Œ Extract the rendering logic to be able to draw onto canvas
- [ ] ðŸ“‘ Write README documentation
- [ ] ðŸŽ† Write more experiments
